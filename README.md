# Ollama Go Client Library

This package defines a partial Ollama client with rich feature set around chat requests with Ollama.
It was created to experiment with the new tool calling functionality in Llama.cpp and Ollama.

See [example/orderbot.go](example/orderbot.go) for an example of how to bind a Go function and provide it as a tool.
